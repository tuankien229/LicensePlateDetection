# LicensePlateDetection

# To do list:
1. Before you run this file you must argumentation image data first because we need more and more data about what we want the machine to learn. For argumentation, I have a file name 'Agumentation_image.py' and you can run it with a dataset I have uploaded in this folder name 'Dataset'.
2. After argumentation, you need to label the raw data by LabelImg to detect where is your license and save the label by Yolo format
3. When we have the Yolo file, data argument, and upload to the drive for training in collab you can run this file for training and see the result.
